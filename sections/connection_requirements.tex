\chapter{Connection requirements}

The problem of transmitting large data is one of the open problems in the information technology research area. A teleoperated system like the one presented in this work need a stable, low-latency connection with high bandwidth requirements. In the proposed framework I needed to transmit different types of data with different requirements. We defined requirements as \textit{critical} when a connection drop could harm the patient or cause damage to the equipment.
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Ultrasound image stream: high bandwidth with medium latency
%	\item Force/Torque measurement from the F/T sensor: very low bandwidth but also very low latency
%	\item Point cloud of the patient: high bandwidth with medium latency
%	\item leader haptic device target pose: very low bandwidth and very low latency
%	\item SMPL body parameters: very low bandwidth and medium latency
