	abstract = {Several established methods for remote touching using non-contact sensors exist. Applications for these methods are primarily within the field of robotic teleoperation. In surgical robotics it would be useful to not only touch, but also be able to maintain a distance from a certain organ. The latter can be done using non-contact sensors such as cameras. The novelty in this paper is the idea of combining forbidden-region virtual fixtures with haptic rendering from streaming point clouds. This is then used to protect as well as remotely touch a beating heart without any a priori knowledge of the heart geometry (such as from CT/MR scans).},

	abstract = {Active constraints, also known as virtual fixtures, are high-level control algorithms which can be used to assist a human in man-machine collaborative manipulation tasks. The active constraint controller monitors the robotic manipulator with respect to the environment and task, and anisotropically regulates the motion to provide assistance. The type of assistance offered by active constraints can vary, but they are typically used to either guide the user along a task-specific pathway or limit the user to within a “safe” region. There are several diverse methods described within the literature for applying active constraints, and these are surveyed within this paper. The active constraint research is described and compared using a simple generalized framework, which consists of three primary processes: 1) constraint definition, 2) constraint evaluation, and 3) constraint enforcement. All relevant research approaches for each of these processes, found using search terms associated to “virtual fixture,” “active constraint” and “motion constraint,” are presented.},

	abstract = {In robot-aided surgery, during the execution of typical bimanual procedures such as dissection, surgical tools can collide and create serious damage to the robot or tissues. The da Vinci robot is one of the most advanced and certainly the most widespread robotic system dedicated to minimally invasive surgery. Although the procedures performed by da Vinci-like surgical robots are teleoperated, potential collisions between surgical tools are a very sensitive issue declared by surgeons. Shared control techniques based on Virtual Fixtures (VF) can be an effective way to help the surgeon prevent tools collision. This letter presents a surgical tools collision avoidance method that uses Forbidden Region Virtual Fixtures. Tool clashing is avoided by rendering a repulsive force to the surgeon. To ensure the correct definition of the VF, a marker-less tool tracking method, using deep neural network architecture for tool segmentation, is adopted. The use of direct kinematics for tools collision avoidance is affected by tools position error introduced by robot component elasticity during tools interaction with the environment. On the other hand, kinematics information can help in case of occlusions of the camera. Therefore, this work proposes an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for pose estimation which ensures a more robust application of VF on the tool, coupling vision and kinematics information. The entire pipeline is tested in different tasks using the da Vinci Research Kit system.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a method for generating dynamic virtual fixtures with real-time 3D image feedback to facilitate human–robot collaboration in medical robotics. Seamless shared control in a dynamic environment, like that of a surgical field, remains challenging despite extensive research on collaborative control and planning. To address this problem, our method dynamically creates virtual fixtures to guide the manipulation of a trocar-placing robot arm using the force field generated by point cloud data from an RGB-D camera. Additionally, the “view scope” concept selectively determines the region for computational points, thereby reducing computational load. In a phantom experiment for robot-assisted port incision in minimally invasive thoracic surgery, our method demonstrates substantially improved accuracy for port placement, reducing error and completion time by 50\% (p=1.06×10−2) and 35\% (p=3.23×10−2), respectively. These results suggest that our proposed approach is promising in improving surgical human–robot collaboration.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a teleoperated dual-user system incorporating Virtual Fixtures (VFs) that allows concurrent performance of a robotic surgical task by an expert and a trainee. In order to guide the trainee through the procedure, an adaptive VF is created in the trainee's workspace according to the motion generated by the expert who is performing the surgery at the same time. The VF gets adaptively adjusted based on the level of expertise the trainee shows during the surgery. In addition, the trainee's level of expertise is used to adaptively adjust the dual-user dominance factor in an online fashion, which gives the trainee some authority over the task based on his/her skill level. To quantify the trainee's expertise level, a performance measure is proposed, based on the force generated by the VF. Three performance measures from the literature are also used. To satisfy the desired objectives of the proposed system, an impedance-based control methodology is adopted. Stability of the closed-loop system is investigated using the small-gain theorem. A sufficient stability condition is derived that guarantees stability in the presence of time-varying communication delay. Experimental results are given to validate the performance of the system.},
